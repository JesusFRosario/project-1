### User Story
AS A user:
- I WANT to be able to quickly search for current COVID-19 statistics by State
    - SO THAT I can stay informed about the pandemic
    - AND I WANT to be able to see a random joke to lighten the mood 
    - SO THAT I don't feel quite so bummed out by the ongoing crisis

### Acceptance Criteria

- WHEN I open the app
    - THEN I am presented with a search bar
    - THEN I can type in either a state's full name or abbreviation (e.g., California or CA) without worrying about case-sensitivity

- WHEN I type in a state's name or abbreviation
    - THEN I can click the Search button to look up COVID-19 data for that state
    - THEN I can see COVID-19 statistics for that state display
    - THEN the numerical data will have thousands-separator (commas) to make the numbers easier to read
    - THEN the full name of the state will display in title case, even if I searched by the state's abbreviation
    - THEN the state's name is saved to local storage
    - THEN a search button for the state will append to the search history list

- WHEN I click on a state's button in the search history
    - THEN it will display the latest statistics for that state
    

- WHEN I misspell a state's name
    - THEN I will see an error modal

- WHEN I refresh the page
    - THEN the saved events persist
